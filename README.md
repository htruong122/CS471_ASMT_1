# CS471_ASMT_1
This project implements a simple HTTP web server and a client in Python. The server listens for incoming HTTP requests and responds with the requested file if available or a `404 Not Found` error if the file does not exist. The client connects to the server, sends an HTTP GET request, and displays the server's response.
